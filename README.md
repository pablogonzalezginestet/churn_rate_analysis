# churn_rate_analysis

# Goal of this project: 
To understand the factors that drives the churn rate in the telecommunications industries.

# Main conclusions:
The churn rate is driven mainly by monthly contracts and to a lesser extent by those customers that do not have extra services like backup, security, protection and technical support. The company should focus on these customers offering discounts in order to increase the chances to retain them for longer time.  

# Data Source
The dataset used in this project is hosted by Kaggle

# Data Modeling
I use survival analysis tools like Kaplan-Meier, Cox Regression Model, Survival Random Forest and Deep Neural Network for survival outcomes.
